                Hello, my name is James de Raat.<br><br> 
                
                I am a motivated and enthusiastic Business Management / Information Technology student at the University of Queensland. 
                My aspirations include UX design and both back-end and front-end software development. I have a strong love for all things 
                sport, particularly cricket, which I play regularly. I love to socialise, be around people, and meet new people.
    
                <br><br>I am always available for the opportunity of having new learning experiences. I love challenging myself to grow as an individual.

                Dine Locator is an interactive web-app that gives has been designed with the 
                intention of allowing users the ability to find a place to eat, even if they have no idea what they desire.
                It has been created in a way that is fun for the user, especially with its spin-the-wheel function that 
                will randomly select a food place type and give suggestions. Its bookmark function allows for the user
                to keep a record of food places they have loved or wish to go to for the first time.<br><br>

                My role in the project was the sole coder of the web app, while I did contribute towards some documentation areas. 
                This involved using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to code the front and back end of the web app in Visual Studio Code.
                Additionally, our team had a GitHub which was used throughout the project.

            <p>
                Over the course of the semester, our team went through many different phases, namely the prototype, the MVP and the final
                product. Over the course of this period, we recieved a significant amount of feedback which forged our decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 2C - Design Proposal</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h4>Task Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a prototype for our website</li>
                <li>Present it to the class in 5 minute presentaiton</li>
                <li>Utilise an API from any source</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Contribution</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented first five slides of the presentation</li>
                <li>Attaining and breaking down the API/dataset for Dine Locator</li>
                <li>Conducted testing on personas of Dine Locator</li>
                <li>Determined target audience</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>
                I feel as a team I felt we presented an effective concept, and something that was very feasible for this course. 
                The only critical feedback that we received after presenting was that we did not include the team roles within our group. 
                We felt that everyone in the group would contribute to different aspects. This was an important section of the design process
                for us as a team since it allowed for the strucutre of the website to be determined. From this point forwards, it would be critical
                that the implementation followed a similar structure. From this task, to project 2D, it was critical that we outlined which were the most
                important aspects of the website, and how users would interact with the website.
            </p>
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>
                Producing a Dine Locator stemmed from Project 2A, and one of our team members' projects. Dine Locator itself came from the idea of 
                not knowing what to eat. In this case, a web app which would be able to identify food places close to their location would be incredibly
                helpful. In addition, if the user genuinely had no idea, the idea of the spin-the-wheel to find random food options was a critical 
                aspect of our interaction process, almost a selling point of the idea.
            </p>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
                Our research came in many forms, but the predominant research we did as a team was into the ideaology of uncertainty, since Dine Locator 
                directly aimed to address this issue. The next section is directly taken out of our research.<br><br>

                "Our idea of the spin-the-wheel of our project, is inspired by and correlated to the two psychological phenomena: indecisiveness, and the emotions that a 
                “gacha game” could bring to us."<br><br>

                As discussed previously, the team decision to have the spin-the-wheel for helping make decisions was to help people who are
                indecisive to make random decisions on where to eat. Our research showed that in doing this, it could likely reduce anxiety and stress
                that indecisiveness can cause. Addtionally, the game itself was inspired by a "gacha game". Gacha is a Japanese word, which refers to capsule
                toy vending machines.<br><br>

                In combination of those research areas, we felt that our Dine Locator concept was, in fact, of assistance to those who were indecisive and also
                wanted to find somewhere to eat.
            </p>

            <h4>Prototype Design</h4>
            <img src="images/prototype-design.png" alt="prototype design">
            <p>
                Our original prototype included these designs. While we did make changes along the evolution of Dine Locator (as will be seen later),
                the majority of these features remained consistent throughout the project.<br><br><br>

                The four pages, we as a team promoted at this stage where:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The homepage: this would be responsible for having a map which would show the food places</li>
                <li>The spin-the-wheel page: as discussed, would be responsible for choosing a random food type and giving suggestions</li>
                <li>The search page: give the user the ability to use preferences to find a food place</li>
                <li>A profile page: giving the user the ability to make an account, save food places, etc (this was later changed)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Project 2D - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>
            <p>
                The MVP (minimum viable product) was responsible for us as a team deciding on the most critical aspect of our website and
                implementing that in a manner that is functional and effective.
            </p>

            <h4>MVP Description</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our team decided that the MVP would be implementing the spin-the-wheel page. In order to do this the we had to implement
                    the index (homepage), which would contain a navigation bar to be able to access the spin-the-wheel page. Following this, 
                    the spinning wheel itself would have to be implemented, before accessing the API to retrieve results based off the landing of
                    the spin-the-wheel.
                </li>
                <li>This would have to be presented in a manner that is engaging to the audience. Limited to 5 minutes, this would showcase our
                    MVP. We aimed to recieve feedback so as we could improve our final product for the final submission in week 13.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Contribution</h4>
            <p>I was responsible for the entire coding of the MVP, this included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implementing the homepage (designing a navbar that matched the prototype, placing a map which retrieved results
                    from the API, linking to spin-the-wheel page)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implementing a spinning wheel that randomly landed on 6 different results corresponding to the industry_desc field
                    of the API. Done in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attaining results from spinning wheel, and displaying different food options corresponding to the result (i.e. Cafes)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, utilising CSS to make it so the spin-the-wheel was centered and the results where placed in the correct area.
                    In most cases, attempting to remain as close to the prototype as feasibly possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img id="mvp-img" src="images/mvp-implemenation.png">

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>
                The MVP presentation was met with a considerable amount of success, while we did have areas which we felt needed improvement. I felt my
                contribution to this aspect of the project was beyond expectation and I was relatively happy with how the website itself was progresing. 
                One of the main areas of critique we recieved as a team was that the spinning wheel, while a cool idea, was not engaging and dynamic enough
                for the user. Upon recieving this feedback, I did tend to agree, and hence one of my main focuses leading into the final product development 
                would be making it more engaging. Overall, it must be said that we as a team were happy with the direction of the website and felt with minor
                improvements and the last features implemented that it would be an engaging and interactive website.
            </p>

            <h4>Remaining Implementation</h4>
            <p>My role, up until this point, had been coding the website and this was not expected to change coming into the final submission of this project.
                Areas which still required to be implemented at this point were:<br>
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Detailed search page, allowing users to search based off preferences,</li>
                    <li>Profile page, allowing the user to make a profile and bookmark food places,</li>
                    <li>Overall graphics of the website need to be improved, and</li>
                    <li>Possibly change the way the results are presented on the spinning wheel page.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Additionally, any feedback we recieved along the journey, would be considered, and in most cases, implemented.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Project 2E - Final Product and Tradeshow</h3>
            <p>
                This final project of the semester presented an incredible opportunity to develop the website to its full potential and present it 
                to a group of people who would get to interact with the website.
            </p>
            <h4>Deliverables</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed web application</li>
                <li>Design report</li>
                <li>Trade show presentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Contribution</h4>
            <p>Like with the MVP, I was responsible for the entire implementation of the website. Contributions I made were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Altering the spin-the-wheel page so every result that was displayed had a corresponding bookmark button.
                    If this button was clicked, that food place would be added to localStorage and hence accessed later. This was done
                    through JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implementing bookmarks on the website as part of the My Profile page. As mentioned, if food places were bookmarked
                    they would be saved to localStorage. Upon this, the My Profile page would access these and display them. Additionally,
                    a remove button was added which allowed entries to be deleted from localStorage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented the search page function of Dine Locator. This page was designed so users could have a set of preferences
                    and based off these, results would be shown from the API. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Changes were made to the homepage, which gave it an additional menu below the map by clicking 'explore'
                </li>
                <li>
                    Changes were made from the spin-the-wheel page based off user feedback. This included having custom backgrounds for when
                    the user lands on results. For example, if the user landed on restaurants, a blurred image of a restaurant would be the background
                    upon landing. In addition to this, sound effects were added for when the user clicks spin, and when the user lands on a result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also contributed towards the report for this submission by doing the process section.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tradeshow</h4>
            <img alt="Tradeshow image">
            <p>Tradeshow explanation</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>
                Overall, Dine Locator has been very successful in achieving what we aimed to achieve. From my perspective, my main role within the 
                team, besides for being team leader, was to implement the coding and I am happy with what I have achieved. I felt that the feedback we
                recieved from tutors over the majority of the course has really assisted me with making critical decisions when it came to the website.
                The main changes that I made were with regards to the profile page. Originally, our prototype and MVP had a goal of making a login/join us
                page which would have allowed for multiple users. Ultimately, we felt as a team that this was not necessary since the primary function of
                this page was to bookmark food places and this could be achieved in a much simpler manner. Additionally, the search page unfortunately had
                to be limited to just two search preferences since the dataset was limited in ways.<br><br>

                This final product was a pleasure to be apart of and I am very pleased with how our team operated. The tradeshow was a success and this is
                testament to the hard work that our team put in over the culminating weeks of the semester.
            </p>

            <p>
                As discussed, there were changes that were made as a result of feedback we recieved after the MVP. These are shown in the above images.

        <h2>Course Reflection</h2>

        <div class = reflection-content>
            <h3>Expectations & Recommendations</h3>
            <p id="reflection-heading">
                "I expect to be fluent with APIs in HTML and JavaScript since this appears to be the primary focus of the classes and assessment pieces that follow."
                - First journal entry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From what has been said as part of my first journal entry, it is clear that I felt I wanted to learn more about JavaScript in particular.
                Of course, when I wrote this I had no idea what my role within the team would be; however, this makes it relatively clear what I thought
                the course would teach me.<br><br>

                I believe that the project and course did, in fact teach me about this for numerous reasons, these include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The content in-class contributed towards achieving this part of my first journal entry. The most prominent was in the earlier stages
                    of the course when we went over how to access APIs first of all, and then how to implement them. I had never used APIs in all my time 
                    at university so far so this was a mind-opening experience for me which I enjoyed massively. I feel that, from these classes, it was the
                    starting point towards me learning to code with APIs and then this was applied to the project over the semester. I did feel; however, that
                    the structure in which this course was taught was unusual since I felt I had no opportunity to learn PHP to the extent in which I would have
                    felt comfortable implementing it for Dine Locator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second aspect that helped achieve this goal was through the actual project itself. As I was the sole coder of the team's website,
                    it gave me a large amount of responsibility for the website and I feel that I used this to great effect to learn about how to access APIs
                    and harness its data for the purpose of a website. Not only did I enjoy the process of working with APIs but I also enjoyed determining
                    how I could use this data to make a functional website.<br><br>

                    Perhaps the only limitation to this was the time that I had readily available for achieving what I necessarily wanted to achieve. For example
                    there were other features that I wanted to add to the website that I did not have time to do. This was mainly due to me being the only
                    person available to code. My team did not feel comfortable coding so I took it on as my job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While this point did not mention CSS as a feature of learning, I did also feel that CSS was a major part of this project as far as my 
                    learning was considered. While I had done CSS in the past, I did learn a considerable amount of throughout this course. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p id="reflection-heading">
                "I hope that I can prosper in a good team environment, and that everyone has their allocated work and achieves it. 
                As a result of this, I hope to achieve a good grade in this course."
                - First journal entry
            </p>

            <p>
                This point was less focused on the actual learning of the course, but more on the team aspect of the course which, as mentioned throughout this
                portfolio, is a critical component of this project.<br><br>

                I do believe that this criteria for the course was met mostly, but did have issues for these reasons:

                    Perhaps the main issue I felt as a team was the workload that was placed on me throughout the course. I always wanted to be up-to-date
                    with the content and on top of this project, but it did not always feel that was the case with my team. Being the team leader, I felt
                    it was my responsibility to get everyone doing their parts appropriately, but it did feel as if I did more work than the other individuals
                    a part of the team. That being said, in the end a lot of the written components were completed without my assistance, but it would have 
                    been nice, at times, to have some assistance with the code. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    On another note, I did feel that our team did work well together in the sense that we had similar visions on where we wanted the website to go.
                    This aspect of the team was effective, and as a result of this the prototype we established early on in the project was kept to and hence
                    the interactiveness and functionality of the website went as planned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As for the grades we have achieved, it is fair to say that I have been a little disappointed throughout the project due to our team perhaps
                    not completing the work to the standard I would have wished; however, with these last assessments in consideration, I believe that we have done
                    a much more improved job than the previous two assessment pieces.

            <h3>Learning Experience</h3>

            <p>
                I feel that I have learnt a considerable amount to do with web programming as a result of the creation of Dine Locator. While I did not have
                much to do with the prototyping of this project (since it was not my original concept), I still feel that having being exposed to more content
                that is design focused, it has allowed me to gain experience that I can use in future courses and work experience in the future.<br><br> 
                
                In some cases, I was unimpressed with the way that this course was structured, particularly through the later practical classes and a majority of 
                the contact classes. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I felt that some of the contact classes did not necessarily assist towards either learning course content or assist with teams. 
                    For example, at the beginning of the course, I felt that it was very unusual that for a team-based course that we would only be able
                    to form a team in week 5 (public holiday in week 4) only for an assessment piece to be due directly a week later (with people I had no
                    experience with). To me, this was a major flaw and led to perhaps worse grades in the course. The work I did in the first three weeks 
                    of this course was rendered useless since it was not my idea that was chosen, and while that was always going to be the case for some people, 
                    I really do feel this aspect of the course could have been structured more effectively. Additionally, I felt like during the MVP, such little
                    attention was given towards the coding aspects of this course and, at one stage, it felt like the class was identical two weeks in a row.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second, and perhaps more concerning matter of this course was the introduction of PHP. I personally found it very confusing that PHP
                    was introduced so late into the course. To make matters worse, the 2 weeks prior to this were spent going over content like storyboards, 
                    something that everyone had already done in previous courses and during contacts. As a result of this, I never felt comfortable enough with
                    PHP where I felt I could use it for Dine Locator and hence I never really focused on it and never learnt it.

                <li>PAF for students to rate other students performance</li>
                <li>More practical contact classes</li>
                <li>Less attention towards previously known/obvious concepts (i.e. storyboards)</li>
                <li>Earlier team formation</li>
                <li>Percentage based grading and final grade formation (i.e. 64% on an assessment is 64% not rounded down to a 4)</li>

               <br>This portfolio has been designed with the primary focus being on Dine Locator's evolution and how I have contributed to this being possible.<br><br>

               The portfolio you see here was created and designed by myself and has been done using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS coding languages. I am
               pleased with how it looks and captures my semester excellently. I feel that overall this course has been enjoyable, but certainly has room
               for improvement. The website's design inspiration came from a previous year student's work and how they structured their website, whereas the
               colour decisions were purely for my likening to the colour green.<br><br>

               If this webpage was to be improved, the primary consideration would be making it more responsive (i.e. making it look better on different
               screen sizes like a mobile device).
